# BESTLab Platform

One package to access multiple different data sources through their respective API platforms.

## Install

In conda or virtualenv environment, run the following commad:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U bestlab_platform
```

If you are using Windows with Anaconda installed, use the following command in Anaconda Prompt:

```
pip install -U bestlab_platform
```

## Usage

### HOBO Platform

#### Example

```python
import json
from bestlab_platform.hobo import HoboAPI


CLIENT_ID = "aaaaa"
CLIENT_SECRET = "bbbbbbbbbbbbb"
USER_ID = "123456"

# Uncomment the following lines to show all debug output
#
# import logging
# from bestlab_platform.hobo import HoboLogger
# HoboLogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

hobo_api = HoboAPI(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, USER_ID)
print(f"access token: {hobo_api.token_info.access_token}")

devices = [
    "123456789",
    "987654321"
]
start_time = '2021-10-15 00:00:00'
end_time = '2021-10-15 01:00:00'
response = hobo_api.get_data(devices, start_time, end_time, warn_on_empty_data=True)
# Pretty print the JSON object from response
print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

[hobo_example.py](https://github.com/umonaca/bestlab_platform/blob/master/example/hobo_example.py) is another working example which reads in the secrets from a single`.env` file. It requires `python-dotenv` package. 

**Note:** Since HOBO APIs are extremely straightforward, you can definitely write your own script without any extra packages (including this one) except for `requests`package. However, there are some extra functionality provided by this package:

- exception handling
- logging with standard format (including timestamps etc.)
- caching and reusing of existing unexpired access tokens

### Tuya Platform

#### Example

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
"""Tuya API"""
from __future__ import annotations

import json
from bestlab_platform.tuya import TuyaOpenAPI, SmartHomeDeviceAPI, TuyaDeviceManager

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ENDPOINT = "https://openapi.tuyaus.com"
    CLIENT_ID = "aaabbbbcccc"
    CLIENT_SECRET = "dddddddddd12345"

    # Uncomment the following line to print messages when querying device logs on Tuya platform
    #
    # import logging
    # from bestlab_platform.tuya import TUYA_LOGGER
    # TUYA_LOGGER.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    #
    # If you want to debug requests and responses, uncomment the following line.
    # TUYA_LOGGER.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

    tuya_api = TuyaOpenAPI(ENDPOINT, CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET)
    print(tuya_api.token_info.access_token)

    # map of device name (your choice, can be any string, for readability) -> device id (in Tuya's system)
    devices = {
        "PIR3": "asdasdadx",
        "PIR4": "12345abcde"
    }

    # Unix timestamp in your local zone, can be 10 digit or 13 digit int, float, or string
    start_timestamp = "1634005305000"
    end_timestamp = "1634523705000"

    # Example 1: Query in batch
    device_group = TuyaDeviceManager(tuya_api, device_map=devices)
    devices_log_map = device_group.get_device_log_in_batch(
        start_timestamp=start_timestamp,
        end_timestamp=end_timestamp,
        warn_on_empty_data=True
    )

    # Save to JSON files
    for dev_name, device_log in devices_log_map.items():
        with open(f'{dev_name}_historical_1017.json', 'w') as f:
            json.dump(device_log, f)

    # Example 2: call API for a single device
    # You can use the code above or the following. It's flexible.
    response_device_status = SmartHomeDeviceAPI(tuya_api).get_device_status(devices["PIR3"])
    print(response_device_status)

    response_device_log = SmartHomeDeviceAPI(tuya_api).get_device_log(
        device_id=devices["PIR3"],
        start_timestamp=start_timestamp,
        end_timestamp=end_timestamp,
        device_name="PIR3",
        warn_on_empty_data=True
    )
    print(response_device_log)

```

[tuya_example.py](https://github.com/umonaca/bestlab_platform/blob/master/example/tuya_example.py) is another working example which reads in the secrets from a single`.env` file in your working directory. It requires `python-dotenv` package. 

#### Why should I use this package for Tuya platform?

This package **correctly and automatically** handles connection, token caching and refreshing behind the scene so you can focus on your work. It provides functions to call most of the APIs available on their platform (available to our project account), and also added functionalities to:

- Call API for multiple devices in batch.
- Query device logs, correctly follow the pagination and return the entire log available for the period.

It is inspired by [Tuya's own python SDK](https://github.com/tuya/tuya-iot-python-sdk), but their SDK does not work for our projects, because of the following reasons:

- It is only suitable for B-to-C scenarios. It uses API endpoints **scoped to users within the cloud project**. In order to use these endpoints, we have to physically go to where the devices are located and add them again with another mobile app, and add those devices into the correct "Asset".
- It requires subscription to Tuya's message service, which is over complicated.
- It contains too many APIs that we will never use.
- It does not have any function to query device logs. Also, Tuya's API to query the device log is paginated, which requires manual handling. 

[TinyTuya](https://github.com/jasonacox/tinytuya) is another python project which uses a simple function to connect and fetch data from the Tuya IoT cloud. However, their function does not work seamlessly for us because:

- Tuya platform never refreshes current access token, unless you use the refresh token to get a new one. Access token expires two hours later after it is first obtained, which means if we don't refresh the token, we will see an error message.

**Update 10/25/2021**: I have managed to find out Tuya's C-to-C platform package [here](https://github.com/tuya/tuya-connector-python), which uses unscoped API endpoint and Pulsar as message service. However, there is [a bug](https://github.com/tuya/tuya-iot-python-sdk/issues/35) which has not been properly fixed in both of their packages. Tokens are still not refreshed in the correct way with their packages. I have already fixed on my side when I rewrote the Tuya package.
